{"Name":"Firebase - Analytics","Id":3320,"Alias":"firebase-analytics","Description":"Firebase - Analytics\n==========================\n\nFirebase Analytics is a free app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement.\n\nAt the heart of Firebase is Firebase Analytics, a free and unlimited analytics solution. Analytics integrates across Firebase features and provides you with unlimited reporting for up to 500 distinct events that you can define using the Firebase SDK. Firebase Analytics reports help you understand clearly how your users behave, which enables you to make informed decisions regarding app marketing and performance optimizations.\n","Version":"42.1001.0.0","Summary":"A free app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement.","QuickStart":"Get Started with Firebase Analytics for Android\n\nFirebase Analytics collects usage and behavior data for your app. The SDK logs two primary types of information:\n\n - **Events**: What is happening in your app, such as user actions, system events, or errors.\n\n - **User properties**: Attributes you define to describe segments of your userbase, such as language preference or geographic location.\n\nAnalytics automatically logs some events and user properties; you don\u0027t need to add any code to enable them.\n\n\n\nConfiguring Firebase\n--------------------\n\n1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console][1], if you don\u0027t already have one setup.  If you have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, you can use the **Import Google Project** option.  Otherwise, use the **Create New Project** option.\n\n2. Click **Add Firebase to your Android app**.  \n\n  a. Enter your app\u0027s ***Package Name***\n  \n  b. Enter the SHA-1 Hash for your signing certificate.  If you don\u0027t know how to find this, [check out this guide][2]\n\n3. Click **Add App** and download the ***google-services.json*** file generated for you.\n\n4. Add the ***google-services.json*** file to your Xamarin.Android project.\n\n5. Set the *Build Action* for your ***google-services.json*** file to ***GoogleServicesJson***.  \n\nThe build process will take the api keys and values from your ***google-services.json*** and translate them into the correct resource string key/value pairs in your app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Add Analytics to your App\n\nDeclare the `FirebaseAnalytics` object at the top of your activity:\n\n```csharp\nFirebaseAnalytics firebaseAnalytics;\n```\n\nThen initialize it in the `OnCreate ()` method:\n\n```csharp\n// Obtain the FirebaseAnalytics instance.\nfirebaseAnalytics = FirebaseAnalytics.GetInstance (this);\n```\n\n### Log events\n\nOnce you have created a `FirebaseAnalytics` instance, you can use it to log either predefined or custom events with the `LogEvent ()` method. You can explore the predefined events and parameters in the `FirebaseAnalytics.Event` and `FirebaseAnalytics.Param` reference documentation.\n\nThe following code logs a `SelectContent` Event when a user clicks on a specific element in your app.\n\n```csharp\nvar bundle = new Bundle`();\nbundle.PutString (FirebaseAnalytics.Param.ItemId, id);\nbundle.PutString (FirebaseAnalytics.Param.ItemName, name);\nbundle.PutString (FirebaseAnalytics.Param.ContentType, \"image\");\n\nfirebaseAnalytics.LogEvent (FirebaseAnalytics.Event.SelectContent, bundle);\n```\n\n### Confirm Events\n\nYou can enable verbose logging to monitor logging of events by the SDK to help verify that events are being logged properly. This includes both automatically and manually logged events.\n\nYou can enable verbose logging with a series of adb commands:\n\n```\nadb shell setprop log.tag.FA VERBOSE\nadb shell setprop log.tag.FA-SVC VERBOSE\nadb logcat -v time -s FA FA-SVC\n```\n\nThis command displays your events helping you immediately verify that events are being sent.\n\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Firebase component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n==========\n\nYou can learn more about the various Firebase SDKs \u0026 APIs by visiting the official [Firebase][5] documentation\n\n\n\n\n[1]: https://console.developers.google.com/ \"Google Developers Console\"\n[2]: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/MD5_SHA1/ \"Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints\"\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/android/ \"Google APIs for Android\"\n[4]: https://firebase.google.com/console/ \"Firebase Developer Console\"\n[5]: https://firebase.google.com/ \"Firebase\"\n","Hash":"333312347046d90dcca84e13fbc4ae1b","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
